## Loyalytics Business Case: Customer Analytics with Tableau

This project showcases a detailed data analysis of customer transaction data for Loyalytics, an AI and analytics company. Utilizing Tableau, I performed a comprehensive exploration of over 500,000 transactions from Brand A stores in the UAE and Qatar, spanning from 2020 to 2022. The objective was to transform raw data into a set of actionable insights, demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and business intelligence.

Project Highlights
Data Preparation: Managed and cleaned a large-scale dataset (65.7 MB) to ensure accuracy and integrity for analysis.

Calculated Fields: Engineered new data fields to segment customers and transactions, enabling deeper analytical insights.

Interactive Dashboard: Developed a Tableau dashboard that answers critical business questions and provides clear, data-driven recommendations.

Strategic Insights: Uncovered key trends in customer behavior, sales performance, and operational efficiency to drive business strategy.

Key Business Questions & Insights
The analysis was structured to answer the following business questions, with each visualization providing a clear and concise insight:

Customer Loyalty & Behavior
How many customers are registered for the loyalty program?

Insight: 64,947 customers are enrolled, indicating a strong existing customer base within the loyalty program.

Which customer tier currently performs the most transactions?

Insight: The Silver tier accounts for the most transactions (~240K+), significantly outpacing Gold and Platinum tiers. This suggests high initial engagement but a potential opportunity to incentivize progression to higher tiers.

What was the month and year when the majority of people signed up for the program?

Insight: Program sign-ups gained strong momentum post-2019, potentially driven by enhanced marketing or digital adoption efforts.

What was the month and year when the majority of registered Indian customers signed up on the app?

Insight: App adoption among Indian customers surged during 2019, peaking in late 2020. This trend may be linked to targeted promotions or broader smartphone penetration.

Sales and Product Performance
What was the total amount of sales and refunds made in the year 2020?

Insight: The analysis reveals significant sales volatility, which could suggest seasonal demand or campaign-driven spikes. A drastic reduction in refunds later in the period points to improved quality control or more effective return policies.

Brand A has how many distinct product categories?

Insight: Brand A offers a diversified product portfolio with 18 distinct categories.

What was the total number of items refunded in the year 2022?

Insight: There was a substantial decrease in refunded items by 2022, demonstrating a clear improvement in product quality and customer satisfaction over time.

Which item has received the most refunds?

Insight: Refund-prone items are concentrated in a few specific categories, which can inform targeted quality improvements and supply chain adjustments.

What was the total number of freebies distributed in the year 2020?

Insight: The majority of freebies were distributed in a single bulk campaign, indicating a strategic use of promotions for customer acquisition or retention.

Operational Analysis
Find the store city with the highest percentage contribution to overall sales and the store ID within that city with the highest contribution.

Insight: Business is heavily concentrated in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with these two cities contributing a majority of the overall sales. Smaller cities like Fujairah and RAK show low contribution, highlighting potential for localized growth campaigns.
